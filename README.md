This repository demonstrates a common error in VHDL processes: an incomplete sensitivity list.  The provided code showcases a process that is only sensitive to the clock signal, leading to unexpected behavior when the input data changes asynchronously. The solution demonstrates the correct implementation of the process sensitivity list, ensuring that the output reflects changes in both the clock and input data signals.
